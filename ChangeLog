	place to look for the pci.ids file.

	* src/pcils.c, src/scanpci.c, src/Makefile.foo
	Made pcils more like XFree86's scanpci utility than lspci.  Changed
	the name of the source file from pcils.c to scanpci.c.  Eventually
	this will be it's own project somewhere else (or it will whither and
	die).

	Removed this file.  It was an old version of what became
	common_capability.c.

	* common_capability.c:
	Fixed an issue with AGP rate detection for AGP3 devices.
